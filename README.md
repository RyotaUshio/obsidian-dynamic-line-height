# Obsidian Dynamic Line Height for CJK

This [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin dynamically adjusts the height of each line (in Editing View) or paragraph (in Reading View) based on it contains CJK characters. This is useful because CJK characters typically require more line height than European alphabets.

Line height for lines and paragraphs containing CJK characters can be set via [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).
